# A Profoundly Professional Portfolio

## Description

I built this portfolio with the intention of presenting it to potential employers. I wanted a clean yet interesting looking platform to display my work and showcasing some of the skills I have developed during my engineering bootcamp. It presented several challenges as it was my first attempt to build something without starter code. My anchored link containing the image of a bridge would not respond to flexing like the place holder images representing future work. I overcame this by adding a flex-basis of 100% to the anchor and then adding a width of 100% to the image itself.
